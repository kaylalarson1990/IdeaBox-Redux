# IdeaBox-Redux

IdeaBox Redux is an app that allows a user to keep track of their ideas as they arise. They get a great idea, give it a title, jot it down, and it saves to the page. As the ideas accumulate, the user can increase or decrease the quality of each idea and filter through them based on those qualities. There is also a search filter so that the user can easily track down an idea based on the actual text. In between uses, the ideas are saved to the page and persist upon refresh. The user can continue to add ideas as they arise and even assign a new quality if they get bored of those provided as default. If the user no longer likes an idea, they can delete it and it will be removed from the page.

For the developer, IdeaBox Redux is excellent practice for working with localStorage and JSON, as well as JavaScript and even some CSS and HTML. Concepts include iterating through arrays, working with objects, event bubbling and event delegation, and practice with grid and flexbox. It serves as a fun playground and experiment for the developer and a useful idea piggy bank for the user. Feel free to re-create, adapt, and enjoy!
